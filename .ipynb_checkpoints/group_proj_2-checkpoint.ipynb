    "Now we will use our data to look at different aspects of these temperature distributions. First, we will use deciles to determine which observations are ‘normal’ and ‘abnormal’, and illustrate how to use variance. Recall that variance is a measure of dispersion in a frequency distribution, equal to the mean of the squares of the deviations from the arithmetic mean of the distribution. The variance is used to indicate how ‘spread out’ the data is in describing the shape of the distribution. A higher variance means that the data is more spread out. Example: The set of numbers 1, 1, 1 has zero variance (no variation), while the set of numbers 1, 1, 999 has a high variance.\n",

In decile terms, temperatures in the 1st to 3rd decile are ‘cold’ and temperatures in the 7th to 10th decile or above are ‘hot’ (rounded to the nearest decile). We can use Pandas’ `quantile` method to determine what values correspond to the 3rd and 7th decile, across all years in our 1950–1984 subsample."
